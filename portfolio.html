If I recall correctly, the theme was 'absence', which I took full advantage of to focus mainly on programming. My main goal while coding the project was to investigate alternate methods of creating movement systems, which led me to tie my character's movement to an animation state machine. It was an interesting experiment, but it became obvious early on that as the complexity of the control system grew, it would get harder and harder to anticipate how the structure of the Animator Controller flows into each state from anywhere in the machine, meaning it was not easily scalable. Below is the code from one of the states used.</p><object data=\"jetLeft.cs\" type=\"text/plain\" width=\"800\" height = \"400\"></object><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-4 offset-1\"><img src=\"nomoreassets2.gif\"><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Gameplay footage</p></div><div class=\"col-4 offset-1\"><img src=\"nomoreassets3.gif\"><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Demonstration of 4 separate firing patterns added to the character's weapon</p></div></div></div>";

He handled the code surrounding a core mechanic that is more or less the grappling hook from the Just Cause series, and left me in charge of building out the rest of the game. This meant that my role in the project was more oriented towards Unity package use rather than pure programming, though contributions were still made. At the end of it, I had used Unity Probuilder to make the arena, created my first NavMesh and agents with a basic zombie pathing AI, Made another Textmeshpro UI and a bare-bones audio manager. Nothing really glamorous by itself, but having experience with these 3D tools has definitely proved its worth since then.</p><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-4 offset-1\"><img src=\"chaingame2.gif\"><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Gameplay footage</p></div></div></div>";

Normally, that course is intended as an introduction to Unity, with code and assets provided by the teacher in order to ease prospective developers into the process. At this point, I had been tooling around with Unity on and off for years and had been getting serious about it within the past several months, so I felt that I needed to up my game past what was required of me as a bare minimum. When most other people were making 2D platformers with premade sprites, I ended up building a top-down arcade racer. I got some help from a Youtube tutorial in order to set up the movement in a way that allowed drifting, but when the math of it was sorted out I tinkered around with it so that the driving style was to my liking. At the end of it, I had a set of 3 tracks where the best way to navigate through them quickly was to drive through turns sideways and down straightaways in reverse. I even had time to add multiple difficulty options to the AI racers, though their pathing is far from perfect.</p><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Below: code for the game's time split leaderboard</p><object data=\"checkpointManager.cs\" type=\"text/plain\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"></object><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-4 offset-1\"><img src=\"agravracer2.gif\"><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Gameplay footage</p></div><div class=\"col-4 offset-1\"><img src=\"agravracer3.gif\"><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Preliminary playtesting found that driving backwards caused the car to accelerate past its speed cap.

Where most of my game jam projects have a codebase that hovers in the size of 20-40 KB, this one ended up sizing in at around 257 KB.

Using some online tools to separate the background music into vocal and instrumental tracks, I made a toggleable 'Combo Mode' that made the vocals fade in over the instrument track and gave the player a slight speed boost. I also took the code from Operation Big Break that turned variable text into particles and made a version that worked in 3 dimensions. Aside from that, though, I was still feeling out the best practices for 3D games and kept the rest of it pretty simple.</p><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-4 offset-1\"><img src=\"akimbro1.gif\"><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Gameplay footage</p></div><div class=\"col-4 offset-1\"><img src=\"akimbro2.gif\"><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Rather than space to jump, the game is programmed so that double tapping shift causes the player to do a flying leap in the direction of movement.</p></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-4 offset-1\"><img src=\"akimbro3.gif\"><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Brief demonstration of Combo Mode</p></div></div></div>";

I wanted to benchmark my progress in learning Csharp programming and the Unity system, so I gave myself the stipulation going in that I couldn't use tutorials to help me make this, and that I had to finish it within 24 hours from the start. Overall, it was a good test of my ability because Unity's toolkit is mainly oriented towards games that occur in real time rather than in turns. The solution I ended on was that each tile on the checkerboard was in one of several states, which were modifiable by player input and the state of neighboring pieces. On one hand, I made it happen within the constraints I gave myself and a game of checkers can be played in its entirety without any bugs. On the other hand, the code that controls the tile states is both monolithic and contains several instances of boilerplate that came back to bite me through development. For that reason, I consider this to be both an accomplishment and an important mistake to learn from.</p><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">At least at the top level, the code isn't too bad...</p><object data=\"MouseController.cs\" type=\"text/plain\" width=\"800\" height = \"400\"></object><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">...but under the hood you can see where mistakes began piling up as I aimed for the deadline.</p><object data=\"TileController.cs\" type=\"text/plain\" width=\"800\" height = \"400\"></object><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-4 offset-1\"><img src=\"checkers1.gif\"><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Gameplay footage</p></div><div class=\"col-4 offset-1\"><img src=\"checkers2.gif\"><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">A double capture performed by the blue side</p></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-4 offset-1\"><img src=\"checkers3.gif\"><p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">King me!</p></div></div></div>";

It's certainly cleaned up somewhat in comparison to my checkers monolith, but at the end of the day only so much can be done to salvage the situation.

I had a heavy hand in the early concept, so I ended up being tasked as Narrative Lead while my friend Dayne Farris - who was also in the winning group - took charge on the large-scale team management. As such, my responsibilities during the development were to act as liason between him and the various 'departments' he set up, build out the game's story throughout its development, program the tools necessary to implement the story inside of the game, and offer assistance with completing coding tasks whenever possible. From our team of 8 programmers, I contributed roughly 10% of the existing codebase directly, and assisted with other programmers work whenever possible.

                            <h1>Project summaries (in reverse chronological order):</h1>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Project DHPS: Personal project I worked on over the summer between work hours. Made from programmer art, but contains a scratch-built dungeon generator, fully autonomous AI adventurers and RTS-like AI goons for the player to control. A few light building elements are also sprinkled in.</li> <br>
                                <li>Blacksite Theta: Team Class Capstone project, when I wasn't working through my responsibilities as narrative lead on this project I lent my hand to building some of the backend systems, namely audio management and dialog implementation.</li> <br>
                                <li>Lucidus: Team Game Jam project, for my addition to the project I made a melee-based arena combat scene and the animated cutscenes.</li> <br>
                                <li>Root Access: Solo Game Jam project, with the added challenge of using only a single Csharp file. While the end result isn't exactly messy, it proves just why keeping code clean on larger projects is so important.</li> <br>
                                <li>Checkers: Solo Personal project done under a self imposed time limit of 24 uninterrupted hours. Csharp ended up being utilized far more than the Unity engine for this challenge.</li> <br>
                                <li>AkimBro: Solo Game Jam project where I experimented with using Character Controller instead of Rigidbody, along with a dynamic music system and some modified FPS controls.</li> <br>
                                <li>Gorgon Stealth: Game Jam project where I helped a new club member realize his idea of a medusa sneaking around a maze trying to avoid turning the wandering humans inside to stone.</li> <br>
                                <li>Operation Big Break: Solo Dev project that I coded and then re-coded over the course of about a year's worth of spare time. More or less aping Cave Story, but manages to recreate a vast majority of the mechanics. Notably, my codebase for this project contains 257KB worth of .cs files, my largest to date. </li> <br>
                                <li>Agrav Racer: Solo developed class project; a top-down 2D arcade racer with drifting and driving backwards being core mechanics of beating the game.</li> <br>
                                <li>Chain Game: Game Jam project partnered with Lucas Ackman, which was an experiment with recreating the Just Cause grappling hook tool.</li> <br>
                                <li>Let's Make Some Noise: Solo Game Jam project, a simple top down arena combat game.</li> <br>
                                <li>No More Assets: Solo Game Jam project where I fully embraced the concept of programmer art to mess around with state machines.</li> <br>
                                <li>Requiem: The Lost Voices - I made minor contributions to this game jam project, first experience with 3D Unity.</li> <br>
